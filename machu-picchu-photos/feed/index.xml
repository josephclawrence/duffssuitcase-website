Hi Rianne, I didn&#039;t do a trek - unfortunately we didn&#039;t have enough time and we planned the trip a bit last minute. If you can book far enough in advance the Inca Trail should be amazing but it is busy. I met people who did the Salcantay Route and loved it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Sarah! I&#039;m just wondering if you did a multi-day trek from Cusco to reach Machu Picchu or not, and if so which one you chose? I&#039;m trying to decide which trek to go on!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just read a hub from another HubPage writer who wrote about 5 different travel blogs that she likes to follow and yours was one of them.  She also mentioned your fabulous photos.  Judging from this first one that I opened, I can see what she means.  Your photos of Machu Picchu are some of the best that I have ever viewed!]]></description>
