It&#8217;s the kind of place that makes people change their flights, cancel other travel plans, or, in many cases &#8211; decide to\u00a0relocate.<\/p>\n<p>On the Pacific Coast of Costa Rica&#8217;s Nicoya Peninsula, Nosara is a small low-key village of yoga studios, juice bars, laidback restaurants, surf shops and small hotels surrounded by trees and flanked by Playa Guiones, a wide, gently curving stretch of golden sand with a legendary surf break. There are strict rules on development, so there are no buildings near the beach, and there are no big resorts, tourist touts or rowdy bars.When parties do happen, they&#8217;re usually over by 10.30pm &#8211; everyone goes to bed early to get up for surfing. The tiny grocery store sells homemade hummus, raw chocolate spread, vegan chocolate bread and French cheese. \u00a0The notice boards around the village advertise drawing classes, yoga workshops, massages and reggae band gigs. People get around by quad bike, bicycle, golf cart and tuk tuk, and everyone you pass walking on the streets (which are sprayed with molasses and smell like sugary treats) greets you with a friendly Hola! Each day, just before sunset, everyone in Nosara &#8211; including all the dogs in town &#8211; gathers on the beach to watch the sun set over the Pacific Ocean\u00a0together.<\/p>\n<p>Nosara is the kind of beach paradise I&#8217;ve always fantasised about living in. I&#8217;m not the only one &#8211; many people who live in Nosara are expats who either live there full time, or for a few months over the northern hemisphere winter. Many are people who came to Nosara on holiday and just never went home.<\/p>\n<p>I could see why after just the few days it took to get into a Nosara routine: waking up early to the rasping growls of howler monkeys, walking on jungle paths to a yoga studio set in the treetops, drinking a coconut water and eating a bowlful of delicious tropical fruit for breakfast, sitting under a ceiling fan writing stories during the heat of the day, and then heading out to the beach in the late afternoon. After a couple of failed attempts at surfing in Cape Town, I decided to give it another go in the warm ocean in Nosara, so I added surfing lessons to my routine after the first week there.<\/p>\n<p>Learning to surf is\u00a0challenging and scary (read more about my surfing learning curve here) but so much fun &#8211; and the best thing about it is seeing the synergies between riding the waves and practising yoga (breath, focus, connection with nature, meditation), and realising that within surfing you can find a lot of life&#8217;s great lessons.<\/p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t take long to feel part of a community, getting to know restaurant owners and surf instructors and yoga teachers and the Argentinian guy who sells empanadas from a picnic basket, and the ever-friendly Warner, who sells his jewellery at a little stand right by the beach. I even got to know Nosara&#8217;s dogs, greeting my favourite ones with a hug on the beach every sunset.<\/p>\n<p>Travelling is about seeing new places, but it&#8217;s also about getting into the rhythm of a place. After four months of traversing South America, stopping for awhile in Nosara and getting a taste of a simple beachside life, was just what I needed.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/duffssuitcase.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Nosara-10.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4043\" src=\"http:\/\/duffssuitcase.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Nosara-10.jpg\" alt=\"Playa Guiones, Nosara, Costa Rica\" width=\"1400\" height=\"935\" srcset=\"http:\/\/duffssuitcase.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Nosara-10.jpg 1400w, http:\/\/duffssuitcase.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Nosara-10-300x200.jpg 300w, http:\/\/duffssuitcase.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Nosara-10-1024x684.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/duffssuitcase.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Nosara-158.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4039\" src=\"http:\/\/duffssuitcase.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Nosara-158.jpg\" alt=\"Playa Pelada, Nosara, Costa Rica\" width=\"1400\" height=\"935\" srcset=\"http:\/\/duffssuitcase.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Nosara-158.jpg 1400w, http:\/\/duffssuitcase.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Nosara-158-300x200.jpg 300w, http:\/\/duffssuitcase.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Nosara-158-1024x684.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>My guide to Nosara<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>My favourite places and things to eat in Nosara.<\/p>\n<p><strong>La Creperie<\/strong>, a 10-minute walk from Playa Guiones, serves up proper French crepes and delicious casados. My favourites were the caramelised leek and zucchini savoury crepe and the number six &#8211; homemade dark chocolate, shredded coconut, hazelnuts and vanilla ice cream.<\/p>\n<p><strong>La Luna<\/strong> is the only restaurant in Nosara with a beachside setting, right above Playa Pelada. It&#8217;s a pricey spot, but you&#8217;re paying for the glorious view (go just before sunset) and the tasty food &#8211; paper-thin pizzas, Middle Eastern platters (the baba ganoush and hummus are amazing) and the delicious cocktails.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/duffssuitcase.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Nosara-137.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4040\" src=\"http:\/\/duffssuitcase.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Nosara-137.jpg\" alt=\"La Luna Restaurant, Playa Pelada, Nosara, Costa Rica\" width=\"1400\" height=\"935\" srcset=\"http:\/\/duffssuitcase.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Nosara-137.jpg 1400w, http:\/\/duffssuitcase.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Nosara-137-300x200.jpg 300w, http:\/\/duffssuitcase.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Nosara-137-1024x684.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Dee&#8217;s<\/strong> is a small, well-priced Vietnamese restaurant close to Guiones Beach with great veggie pad thai, summer rolls and fish curry.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rosi&#8217;s Soda<\/strong> is one of the only Costa Rican restaurants in Nosara, and a great one it is too.
