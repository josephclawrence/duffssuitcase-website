Even before I knew him well, he seemed like the perfect traveller (and a good person to drink many beers with and chat about everything) &#8211; a hardy motorbiker who takes everything in his stride with good humour and a sense of adventure. I love Anton&#8217;s take on slow travel (he once drove from Cape Town to the Serengeti in a Smart Car, for no particular reason), his genuine enthusiasm for Africa, wilderness and conservation, his choice of really off-the-beaten-track destinations (like Mali), his beautiful photography &#8211; and his portraits in particular &#8211; and his truly inspiring story (<a href=\"http:\/\/peregrinemag.com\/alaska-made-me-an-african-travel-writer\/\" target=\"_blank\">read it here<\/a>) about how he decided to change life track so drastically and give up his career for travel, at a time when most people are settling down to stay in the same place for the rest of their lives.<\/p>\n<p>Anton&#8217;s moved from blogging to a job as the publishing editor of Africa Geographic Magazine, and he&#8217;s about to embark on a new travel venture. He continues to write about what he loves &#8211; conservation, Africa and the beautiful wild places he&#8217;s been to.<\/p>\n<p>Read about Anton&#8217;s travels through Africa on his blog, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brightcontinent.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\">Bright Continent<\/a>, and his blogs and articles on <a href=\"http:\/\/africageographic.com\/blog\/author\/antoncrone\/\" target=\"_blank\">Africa Geographic<\/a>, and follow him on <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/antoncrone\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/antoncrone\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was your first trip without your parents?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The first trip I remember\u00a0<i>with<\/i><span style=\"font-family: arial, sans-serif;\">\u00a0my folks was to the highlands of Nyanga in Zimbabwe. It was a strange time &#8211; there was a war going on. We explored ancient ruins and swam in mountain streams, but dad carried an AK and mom packed an Uzi. We left Zimbabwe for South Africa soon after that. My first trip alone was going back there as a teenager. My parents put me on a long distance bus. They were happy to see me go because I was a real shit, and I\u00a0didn&#8217;t want to come back. I considered Zimbabwe home. I would be staying with family friends on their farm and I thought it was going to be like old times &#8211; playing the fool; getting up to mischief. But I was put to work branding cattle and hoeing fields. My folks had arranged it like that. It did me a lot of good. And I missed them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s been the most meaningful journey you&#8217;ve done?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I hitchhiked from Anchorage to Acapulco in 1999. It was so far from my perceptions of America, and myself. I lived like a hobo. I loved it, and sometimes I hated it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where in the world have you felt happiest?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Probably the Alhambra in Granada, Spain. I had just fallen in love. While we were walking around the gardens, trying to figure each other out, I realised that she must like me because she was laughing at my silly jokes.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/duffssuitcase.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/Pineapple-salesman.jpeg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4415\" src=\"http:\/\/duffssuitcase.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/Pineapple-salesman.jpeg\" alt=\"Pineapple salesman\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1198\" srcset=\"http:\/\/duffssuitcase.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/Pineapple-salesman.jpeg 1800w, http:\/\/duffssuitcase.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/Pineapple-salesman-300x200.jpeg 300w, http:\/\/duffssuitcase.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/Pineapple-salesman-1024x682.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s the best sky you&#8217;ve ever slept under?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The sky above Makgadikgadi Pans in Botswana.
