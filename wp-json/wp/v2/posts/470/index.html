In short, it&#8217;s an amazing city where you could spend weeks and not discover all its treasures.<\/p>\n<p>We only had four days to take in as much as we could of Istanbul&#8217;s history, food, streets and art. In a whirlwind of sightseeing in the <strong>old city<\/strong>, we marvelled at the <strong>Blue Mosque<\/strong> at dusk after all the tourists had left and its minarets started to light up against an inky-blue sky, sat on the floor of the <strong>Aya Sofya<\/strong> under its massive domes trying to take in the layers of history of this spiritually significant building which was a church for a thousand years and then a mosque (the original Christian paintings are still being uncovered), tried to photograph creepy carp who&#8217;d never seen the light of day in the dark and chilly ancient <strong>Basilica Cistern<\/strong> with its mysterious upside-down Medusa heads, took a twenty-minute ferry ride to Asia for TL3 (R15) and ate the best food of our trip at chef Yottam Ottolenghi&#8217;s favourite restaurant in the city, the unpretentious <strong>Ciya Sofrasi<\/strong>,\u00a0bought boxes of sugar-dusted pistachio-and-rosewater Turkish delight from the hectically busy\u00a0<strong>Spice Bazaar<\/strong>\u00a0(which used to be the last stop for caravans travelling the Silk Road from Persia and the Far East), got lost in the labyrinthine alleys of the 500-year-old\u00a0<strong>Grand Bazaar<\/strong>\u00a0among piles of carpets and thousands of glinting blue eyes and multi-coloured lamps, cranked our necks trying to look at every bit of the glitteringly gaudy <strong>Dolmabahce Palace<\/strong>, and tried to conjure up romantic visions of the royal life of the sultans and their beautiful concubines in the <strong>Topkapi Palace<\/strong>, which was the court of the Ottoman Empire for four hundred years.<\/p>\n<p>While the museums, mosques and monuments of Istanbul were incredible, our favourite moments in the city were spent in<strong> Beyoglu<\/strong> (Istanbul&#8217;s most cosmopolitan area, separated from the old city by the Golden Horn, an inlet of the Bosphorus) soaking up contemporary life at a slower pace &#8211; eating syrupy baklava or sesame-encrusted <em>simit <\/em>(bread rings)<em>\u00a0<\/em>on a park bench, eating <em>dondurma<\/em> (Turkish ice cream) while walking with the crowds down Istiklal Street (Istanbul&#8217;s semi-pedestrianised version of Oxford Street), smoking <em>nargile<\/em> (water pipe) and sipping sweet apple tea in beautifully-patterned delicate cups in a tea garden in the late afternoon under the Galata Tower to a soundtrack of tweeting swallows, the call to prayer and honking ships, strolling on the Galata Bridge at sunset watching people catch fish, drinking beer on rooftop bars with spectacular views over the Bosphorus and eating breakfasts of olives, cheese, tomatoes and pastries in quiet courtyards as the city (a late sleeper) slowly came to life.<\/p>\n<p>Travellers have been fascinated by Istanbul for hundreds of years, returning home to Europe to exoticise it in paintings and flowery writing.\u00a0It&#8217;s hard not to get a bit over excited when trying to describe this utterly beguiling city that manages to draw you in almost from the moment you step off the plane.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>My Istanbul highlights<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Walking everywhere<\/strong> (this is not a city for high heels!) &#8211; especially in Beyoglu (the European side of Istanbul) and discovering cool little spots on tiny side streets and steep cobbled roads, like junk shops, second-hand bookshops and bohemian bars in Cihangir, tiny hipster-ish coffee shops on side streets at the bottom of Istiklal Street, street art down alleys and vintage shops packed full of amazing clothes and old paintings in Galata.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/duffssuitcase.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/Walking-Istanbul1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-633\" alt=\"Walking, Istanbul\" src=\"http:\/\/duffssuitcase.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/Walking-Istanbul1.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/duffssuitcase.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/Walking-Istanbul1.jpg 1000w, http:\/\/duffssuitcase.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/Walking-Istanbul1-300x198.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Istanbul has the most amazing <strong>rooftop bars<\/strong>, where you can have a beer and take in views over the city and Bosphorus as the sun sets.

While this makes it convenient to be withing walking distance of places you want to see, this part of town is pretty touristy and at night there isn&#8217;t much going on apart from tourist restaurants. We much preferred staying in <strong>Beyoglu<\/strong>, on the other side of the Golden Horn (which is still the European side). There was much more of a fun vibe here, with loads of bars, restaurants, cafes, boutiques, shops and more locals than tourists around. You can easily walk across the Galata Bridge from Beyoglu to the old city, or take the tram, which is cheap, easy and fast.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Beyoglu<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Noble House Galata<\/strong> is a quirky, hip, friendly little guesthouse on a tiny, quiet side street close to busy Istiklal Caddesi. Each of the eight rooms here is decorated in a different style, from the Sultan Room to the Black Room (we stayed in the Hammam Room, with a massive marble bath). Staff make you feel like you&#8217;re staying in their home rather than a hotel, and make a big effort to help you out with whatever you need. Breakfasts (which you eat outside in the peaceful courtyard\/street) here are a treat &#8211; freshly-baked pastries, tapenades, cheese, parcels filled with nuts and cheese, glace walnuts, cherries, eggs and bread. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.duffssuitcase.com\/hip-and-quirky-istanbuls-noble-house-galata-guesthouse\/\" target=\"_blank\">Read more about Noble House Galata here<\/a>. <em>Doubles from\u00a0\u20ac65. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.noblehousegalata.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.noblehousegalata.com<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/duffssuitcase.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/Noble-House-Galata-Istanbul-31.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-598\" alt=\"Noble House Galata, Guest house, Istanbul\" src=\"http:\/\/duffssuitcase.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/Noble-House-Galata-Istanbul-31.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/duffssuitcase.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/Noble-House-Galata-Istanbul-31.jpg 1000w, http:\/\/duffssuitcase.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/Noble-House-Galata-Istanbul-31-300x198.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Close to the vibey Nevizade Street with its taverns and restaurants packed with singing revellers, <strong>Peradays<\/strong> is also a two-minute walk away from Istiklal.

It&#8217;s an old restored building with a lot of charm &#8211; I loved the rickety winding iron staircase leading up to the rooms from reception and the old vines covering the window frames. The quiet garden courtyard proved to be the perfect place to drink afternoon tea or Turkish coffee after escaping the tourist hordes, and it was also a great spot for breakfast.
