Since then the term \u201cbucket list\u201d \u2013 meaning a list of things to do, see and accomplish before you kick the proverbial bucket \u2013 has taken off, becoming firmly entrenched in popular culture, with travel being a big focus of many lists. The term \u201ctravel bucket list\u201d yields nearly 50 million searches on Google: the Internet is awash with articles proclaiming \u201cThe ultimate travel bucket list: 1001 things to do before you die\u201d, \u201c100 places that should be on your bucket list\u201d and even \u201cThe ultimate Harry Potter travel bucket list\u201d. On Bucketlist.org you can get inspiration from other users\u2019 three million things to do before you die, if you don\u2019t have enough ideas to fill own list. There are multiple smartphone apps that help you create and manage your travel bucket list and share your bucket list experiences with your social media community once you\u2019ve ticked them off.<\/p>\n<p>If you read through some of the many thousands of travel bucket lists posted on blogs and websites, you\u2019ll soon see that there\u2019s a startling similarity in many of the lists\u2019 points: from swimming with dolphins, seeing the Northern Lights and road tripping across the USA to witnessing the Great Migration in the Serengeti, the same things appear over and over.<\/p>\n<p>The problem with bucket lists is that they reduce the vast wonders of the world to the easily packaged consumerist form of a shopping list \u2013 and unfortunately the other shoppers have the same items on their lists to purchase. Experiences become things to acquire \u2013 not unlike material goods. Ticking things off comes with a competitive edge. The benefits of travel \u2013 the learnings, cultural exchanges and personal growth \u2013 are glossed over in favour of the kind of things that look great in Facebook photos: jumping on Great Wall of China, getting a selfie with a penguin in Antarctica, riding a camel in front of the Great Pyramids.<\/p>\n<p>When you make a bucket list, you presuppose what will be the most memorable part of a trip: the great sights. In fact the elevated expectations laden on these places and experiences often leads to disappointment when the pyramids aren\u2019t as big as you expected, or the dolphins don\u2019t seem as friendly as you thought they\u2019d be. Instead, the many joys of travel are the spontaneous, unexpected ones \u2013 the kinds of things that aren\u2019t included in brochures. From getting lost in a foreign city and stumbling on a wonderful local restaurant (the kind of place that wouldn\u2019t have made it into the guidebook), making a new friend on a long bus trip who you stay in touch with for the rest of your life, discovering your own tenacity when your journey throws up an unexpected challenge \u2013 these are often the memories that we keep with us long after the trip is over. You also don\u2019t have to go far for travel to be rewarding \u2013 according to research short, frequent trips boost our happiness much more than long, infrequent holidays.<\/p>\n<p>The American historian Miriam Beard wrote that \u201cTravel is more than the seeing of sights; it is a change that goes on, deep and permanent, in the ideas of living.\u201d The transformative power of travel lies not in visiting the world\u2019s most famous places, but in the way in which immersive experiences enhance, deepen and broaden the way in which you view the world and connect to other people. This kind of travel which cannot be checked off a list is the kind of travel that should make us leave home in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- AddThis Advanced Settings generic via filter on the_content --><!-- AddThis Share Buttons generic via filter on the_content -->","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the 2007 film The Bucket List, two terminally ill characters played by Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman meet in a cancer ward, which they escape to do a road trip to tick off their wish list of things to do, including seeing the Taj Mahal and skydiving, before they die.
