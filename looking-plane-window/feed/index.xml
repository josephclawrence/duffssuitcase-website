					<description><![CDATA[Absolutely beautiful post. I&#039;ve never spent a flight doing anything other than staring out the window in awe!!! I haven&#039;t been on many flights, but flying is by far one of my favourite experiences that life has to offer. We&#039;re going to Texas next month and I&#039;m so excited I can hardly contain myself. It&#039;s almost a blessing to have to fly in the time of COVID, middle seats being kept open and me flying with my partner means I definitely won&#039;t get stuck with an aisle seat :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I remember my first flight. I thought that past the clouds it was space, you know, outside of the planet&#039;s atmosphere. When we went above the clouds I couldn&#039;t believe that there was still plenty of sky left before you made it to space. I still remember thinking how amazing that is.]]></description>
