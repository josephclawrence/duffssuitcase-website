					<description><![CDATA[A very insightful post that I really enjoyed reading.  I agree with the fact that travelling cannot simply be a rush from the one place to the other where you can say that you have visited a place, but you have no real stories to tell. That&#039;s why I don&#039;t Contiki (or something similar), but rather travel slowly and spend a few days in one place.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with you! There is nothing wrong with having a list of places you want to see (just so you don&#039;t get off track and you remember the things you want to see vs. what you don&#039;t) but this whole list making thing has gotten seriously out of control! So many people put things on their list they will never accomplish so when they die their loved ones are extremely saddened that they didn&#039;t get to do those things.]]></description>
