					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/turkish-delight-on-planning-a-trip-to-turkey/#comment-6401&quot;&gt;Francesca&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Francesa,

Glad my blog has been useful! We used Avis and dropped off the car in Dalaman. I&#039;ve written blogs about all the spots we visited on the coast and about the places we stayed at.

I loved both books but Birds without wings was a more engrossing read. 

Have a great trip!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Sarah, 

Love your blog posts!  We are planning a very similar trip to Turkey in early September and I&#039;m now debating how to travel between Cappadocia and the coast. Hope you don&#039;t mind fielding some questions? :)

Wanting to know which car hire agency you went through and what the prices were like..  Also, which spots did you visit on the coast and, if you did it over again, is there a spot in particular where you would choose to linger longer?  Any accommodation recommendations?  And finally where did you drop your car off at the end? 

Thanks so much!  Your blog has been super useful :)]]></description>
