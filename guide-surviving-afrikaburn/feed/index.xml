					<description><![CDATA[Get 3 or 4 disposable camera to document what you see and who you meet. (you can get them processed to digital at Cameraland on Long st. you can also get the cameras there) 

Step away from the crowds and let yourself have a moment to reflect where you are and what is going on around you. 

 Just walk any direction into the desert, the sounds will bring you back. At night, wow, you will become the cosmos… Loose yourself in it, and look at the stars as much as possible, you will realise that is where you have come from, and that’s what is inside of every cell of your body. 

Spending any second looking for someone is wasted time, there are a lot of people you will make friends with every step you take in Tankwa, try to not let yourself be disconnected from them by wanting to be with someone else. 

Have general meeting spots, like front left of any stage, or a particular themed camp… etc. 

One year there was a ground of about 20 friends who all dressed like Wheres Wally, (white &#038; red strips) It can be a good way to move around and recognise each other. 

Take wet wipes, there is a lot of dust, embrace it. let it wash through you… There is something so magical about this place, it will bring out undiscovered parts of yourself. Try write about your experiences, even just a poem for each day. Write about the life lessons you learn.

To get clean, do this at the hottest time of the day around 12h00 I imagine, (don’t track time, listen to the sun) ...to get clean take a 5l of water, walk into the horizon, take all your clothes off, pour it on your head, wash your body, rinse, MOISTURISE, put your clothes back on. fresh.

If you meet anyone called Amber or Jason give them a hug from me. 

It gets really cold at night, and really hot in the day, keep up your fluids, organise mushrooms, weed and all other substances before you get there. It is possible to go without any stimulants, for a purer experience, but I would recommend taking ‘something’, space cookies and ecstasy are always a good idea. 

Take any musical instrument you have, get lost in the freedom, soak up the sun, become the stars, taste the dust, 

You should kiss at least 5 people whether you are single or not. This should not become a priority, but if it would feel right you properly should act on that impulse it will develop you as a burner.]]></description>
