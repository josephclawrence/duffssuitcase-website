Definitely! I think of Namibia often, even though I haven&#039;t been back in a few years. I need to get back to the beautiful Namib soon!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Alissa, the best way to travel around Namibia (a massive country) is by renting a car. Both times we drove our car from South Africa to Namibia but you could also fly into Windhoek and rent a car there. Driving is easy and safe, and while lots of roads aren&#039;t tarred they are in a very good condition. You don&#039;t need to have guides to take you around - just take a decent guidebook and perhaps stay a night or two at a lodge that has guides to take you on nature walks or drives. There are cool day guided tours you can do into the desert with experts on the fascinating flora and fauna. Have an awesome trip!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sarah, great photos, I&#039;m sold too!  I am planning a trip there and working the details soon - how did you travel there? Did you rent a car or mostly book guides?]]></description>

Thanks Roxanne. I know - as soon as I leave Namibia I just want to go back. I haven&#039;t been there for two years now so I&#039;m absolutely dying for a trip! I&#039;d love to go far north to Kaokoveld and Damaraland and do an epic 4x4 trip.]]></description>
