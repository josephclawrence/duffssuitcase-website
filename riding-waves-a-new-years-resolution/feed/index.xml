Hi Sofia,

I felt the same about surfing - I started out in Cape Town, where the water was freezing and crowded with beginners. I felt much more comfortable trying again in Costa Rica where the beach was huge (so you&#039;re never on top of other people) and the sea was really warm. I&#039;d suggest trying it out with an instructor who can make you feel more confident and comfortable. It&#039;s very unlikely that you&#039;ll get anywhere close to drowning as a beginner, but there is the chance that you can get smacked in the face with your board - I&#039;ve been hit on the head a few times and my friend fell flat on her face and you know what? It&#039;s not that bad. You have an egg on your head or a bruise, which goes away in a few days. The thrill of surfing and the stoke you get totally make it all worth it! Good luck and hope you can motivate yourself to get out there!

					<description><![CDATA[Hi! 

I&#039;ve just discovered your blog/website and its amazing!! Such fantastic photography skills, and amazing locations. Congratulations!
I just read your post on surfing. I, too, wanted to learn how to surf. Its always been one of those things I would love to do but was never brave enough. I&#039;m from Portugal, where there are some of the best waves to catch in the world (we&#039;ve had the biggest waves like 2 years in a row or something), so I have no real excuse, but the water is freezing and I&#039;m a such a scardy cat! I just hate the thought of being smacked in the face by the board, or semi-drowning or something. Any tips on how to actually get in the water? I still don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll do it! ahh!]]></description>
