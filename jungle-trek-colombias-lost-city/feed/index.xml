Hi Richard,

I had a small backpack that I usually use for day hikes so it wasn&#039;t ideal. I&#039;d suggest taking a backpack that&#039;s meant for multi-day hikes, although you don&#039;t want anything too big. You also need some waterproof covering for your bag - our guides brought big plastic bags for us. The main thing is to have a bag that&#039;s comfortable! You don&#039;t need anything particularly tough. 

Enjoy the hike!

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Sarah,

would you recommend a backpack of a particular type. Or something you tough would have been really useful on you trip and did not take?]]></description>

Hi Bryan, we did the hike in December (just before Christmas, in fact). I&#039;m not sure what the weather is like in February - just check that it&#039;s not rainy season. I think any time of year is really hot and humid but you don&#039;t want to be going when it&#039;s raining a lot as it will be extremely muddy and the river crossings may be more challenging.]]></description>

Hi Johnny, hope you make it to Ciudad Perdida! Yes it&#039;s true most of it hasn&#039;t been cleared yet but the area with the main ruins is accessible.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[HI, great photos by the way. I am Colombian and plan to visit Medellin and maybe on the way back to NYC I will make a stop to explore this city, I have read a lot about it and it seems to be on the less popular ancient ruins but then again that keeps the mystery alive. I read it hasnt yet been cleared and there are no plans to, is that part accesible,]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Did you do the hike in February? My wife and I were thinking of going in mid-feb. You mentioned that it was super hot. We did the Inca trail hike in Sept. And it was perfect hiking weather, dry and not too hot.
