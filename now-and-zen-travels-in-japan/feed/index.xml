					<description><![CDATA[Ahh ~ I&#039;m almost too jealous of your Japan travels. I&#039;ve been enchanted by Japan for so long, though I haven&#039;t set foot on its soil yet. I know it&#039;ll be one beautiful and unforgettable experience to walk among the shrines and temples of Kyoto or stroll down the quirky streets of Tokyo. Thank you for sharing your experience, it was a worthwhile read and your photos are so lovely!]]></description>
