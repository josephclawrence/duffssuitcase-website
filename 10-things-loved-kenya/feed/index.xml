					<description><![CDATA[Lamu always has a way of capturing the traveller&#039;s heart in such a lasting way that for most, the first time there is never enough and so you will always hear travellers say things like &quot;this is my third time here and i will be back (that phrase is apparently not only reserved for Arnold Schwarzenegger, you will quickly realise while in Lamu). Great collection of travel ideas there Sarah. Cannot wait to go back to Lamu yet again myself despite a couple of stories about the place on our travel blog.]]></description>

Hi Marisa,

You definitely need to go back for Lamu Island! I&#039;m sure I&#039;m missing a lot more points from my list - so I&#039;ll also have to go back :)]]></description>
