					<description><![CDATA[Hi Sarah

This is the site I have been looking for.  We are leaving for Mauritius next Saturday 4th Jan 2014. Apart from the beaches I want to venture off the beaten track and explore the culture of the island as well.  Any advice as i am hiring a car to drive around.

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve never traveled outside South Africa, I took my very first flight a few weeks ago during my working trip exploring South Africa. I had the best time of my life and I see myself slowly falling inlove with traveling, am I soon to be a travel blogger? That&#039;s the question I keep asking myself. Great post!]]></description>
