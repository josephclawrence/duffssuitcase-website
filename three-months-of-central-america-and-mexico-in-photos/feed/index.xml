It sounds like a wonderful tour of Central America. If you loved Guatemala, I recommend you return sometime to visit Nicaragua...lots of beautiful cities and wonderful nature to explore.]]></description>

Hi Katarina, thanks for being such an avid follower of the blog! I have been travelling - through Central America, Iceland and Europe - and I took a little break from blogging. Working through my blogging backlog at the moment!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I thought you were traveling! It made me a bit worried when you didn&#039;t post anything for several months! Can we have a little warning next time or was this completely unplanned/away from internet? Good to know you&#039;re safe! Beautiful photographs as always!]]></description>
