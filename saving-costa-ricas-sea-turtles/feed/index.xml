					<description><![CDATA[Saving endangered sea turtles sometimes seems to be a losing battle... We&#039;ve participated in programs on Mexican beaches to help release baby sea turtles to the sea - it&#039;s so sad to see birds swoop in and grab the hatchlings flailing around in the surf. Perhaps, however, this Costa Rica conservancy and other sanctuaries around the world will help tilt the scales in favor of the turtles&#039; survival...]]></description>

Thanks for your comment, Roxanne. Yes, it was incredibly disheartening! I guess the main thing is not to get despondent but to each try and help in our own way.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Tortuguero National Park, on Costa Rica&#8217;s Caribbean coast, is the Western hemisphere&#8217;s main nesting site for green turtles: during the nesting season (April to October) there are as many as 700 turtles laying their eggs on a 30-kilometre stretch of protected beach. You can hire a certified guide to take you to the beach at night to watch turtles nesting &#8211; a truly magical wildlife experience which feels like watching a dinosaur in action. (Read more about my turtle nesting experience here.) [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t say I envy you the humidity or even the hallucinations, but I deeply envy you for the awe of seeing this ancient ritual. So disheartening to know the eggs were stolen. We as humans have an awful lot to answer for in our dealings with nature.]]></description>
