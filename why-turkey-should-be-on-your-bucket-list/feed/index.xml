Hi Lauren,

We rented a car so I&#039;m not sure about public transport routes on the coast. Maybe try Olympos? It&#039;s a popular spot but not too crowded - and there are loads of hotels and restaurants along the beach so you would be fine without a car. Enjoy your trip!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Sarah, 
Love reading your posts. You have inspired me so much to go to Turkey and that&#039;s just where i&#039;m heading next month!
If you had only 4 days to spend somewhere on the turquoise coast (flying into Antalya and out again to Cappadocia), where would you choose to spend your time? What was your favourite place?I prefer to be away from the crowds however I won&#039;t be hiring a car so somewhere that can be reached on public transport. 
Thanks in advance! :)]]></description>

There&#039;s so much to do on the coast! I can&#039;t wait to go back sometime soon and explore more of it. Hope you had an amazing trip!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Truly it should be on anyone&#039;s bucket list a few times, there&#039;s so much to see! I&#039;ve spent days just in the North Aegean coast before heading off for Istanbul. The South coast, and Antalya region are for another trip. The Aegean coast is also a great jumping off point for some Greek islands.]]></description>

Thanks Mari! Glad I could help you start getting excited for your trip! I&#039;ll be posting more blogs (which will hopefully also be inspiring) about Turkey over the next week.]]></description>
