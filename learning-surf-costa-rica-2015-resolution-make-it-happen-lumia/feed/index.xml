					<description><![CDATA[This is great! I&#039;m like you, also a huge scaredy cat. I don&#039;t like to do anything that could possibly cause me harm. I have given surfing a try and was not very successful, for many reasons. So kudos to you for overcoming your fear and tackling it head on, literally! Maybe I&#039;ll get out there and give it another shot.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s rad to see that you followed through with this. So many of us set the intention but don&#039;t make the effort to follow through. I think I might just give that longboard another shot :) Thanks Sarah!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing, Sarah! You&#039;ve made a very important point in this article: fear is a common and normal part of life; learning to see it for what it is, and deciding when it&#039;s necessary to ignore it and follow your dreams, is an empowering way to live. Amazing; I hope to do something like this in the near future!]]></description>

Well done for actually doing this thing. Also I think your pictures  on this website are inspiring for would be travelers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Huge kudos Sarah. I remember a conversation with someone wise who said surfing is the purest form of exercise and the best possible zen one can experience in life. Judging by your adventures and hearing from J how profound it&#039;s been on him, this seems to still hold true :)]]></description>
