					<description><![CDATA[Absolutely beautiful post. I&#039;ve never spent a flight doing anything other than staring out the window in awe!!! I haven&#039;t been on many flights, but flying is by far one of my favourite experiences that life has to offer. We&#039;re going to Texas next month and I&#039;m so excited I can hardly contain myself. It&#039;s almost a blessing to have to fly in the time of COVID, middle seats being kept open and me flying with my partner means I definitely won&#039;t get stuck with an aisle seat :)]]></description>

Hi Ali, no I don&#039;t think you could do this trip without a car. We visited some pretty remote spots - the farmstays and hikes - which you wouldn&#039;t be able to reach by public transport. It was easy to drive ourselves though, and a fun way to explore the country. Hope you have a good trip!]]></description>
