					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/how-i-achievemore-on-my-travels/#comment-214657&quot;&gt;Jenny&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Jenny! Nice to hear from you :) Yes, change of climate is the hardest thing about long-term suitcase living. I&#039;ve found that having a down Uniqlo jacket that fits into a tiny pocket, a beanie, scarf and a thermal vest has seen me through cold weather (even snow in Patagonia!). When it&#039;s really cold I just wear all my layers at once. I also bought a cheap (child&#039;s) jacket at a second-hand shop in Reykjavik (where all the other outdoor gear cost hundreds of dollars) to see me through a freezing two weeks there. I&#039;ve also met up with friends and family along the way so I&#039;ve been able to ask them to bring me a few things and sent things home with them, so I have been lucky enough to do some changeovers of clothes. Warm weather countries are easier of course - shorts and vests and flip flops don&#039;t take up too much space. No, I don&#039;t use packing cubes - what are they? I use the cigar rolling method for packing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Sarah! This is @otherworlds__ from Insta and i&#039;ve just thoroughly stalked your website/blog and ah man, you inspire me so much to keep going! Your photography is just beautiful and I&#039;m having a great time reading your blog posts. After living out of a suitcase for a good while now, I struggle most with the change of climate from country to country. A question: do you use packing cubes?]]></description>

Yeah - we certainly do! 

I&#039;m up in Kenya at the moment working for an elephant conservation charity (www.spaceforgiants.org) - but there is not a day that goes by when I dont think of Cape Town!]]></description>

Pleasure! Hope you enjoy it :)

Would definitely like to meet up if we&#039;re in Cape Town at the same time (I&#039;m back in October). I had a look at your website and it seems like we have a lot in common!]]></description>

Thanks Maurice! I loved your comment and your travel attitude - I think so many people come up with excuses for not travelling, when it&#039;s all about just going and working things out (work, money etc) when you get there. You&#039;ve won yourself a Lumia phone - hope you use it to document your travels in the future! Lumia will be in touch to find out your details to send you the phone. Congrats :)]]></description>
